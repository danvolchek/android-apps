# CampusMap

Displays a map with routes between classes for every day of the week. Also includes floorplans for most UIUC buildings. Very useful if you are new to the campus and have many classes in different places right after each other. Uses the Google Maps Android API to find routes and show the map.

The sliding layer code was gained from https://github.com/wunderlist/android-sliding-layer-lib.
